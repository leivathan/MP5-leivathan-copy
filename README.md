# MP5-leivathan-copy
This is my (Andrew Kim's) copy of Machine Project 5, Lists and Recursion, for the 2018 spring semester of the class CS 125 at the University of Illinois.
The goal of the project was to understand how to navigate through lists and how to create well-made recursive functions.
This was accomplished through working with linked lists (with documentation that can be seen at this address: https://cs125-illinois.github.io/Spring-2018-MP5-Starter/SingleLL.html), binary search trees (https://cs125-illinois.github.io/Spring-2018-MP5-Starter/Tree.html), and DNA sequences (https://cs125-illinois.github.io/Spring-2018-MP5-Starter/DNA.html).
The specifics of the work was to create functions inside of these classes that use recursive functions to accomplish its goal.
The code which I, Andrew Kim, worked on is marked by commits that start with the phrase: "I got my insert and constructors finished. I'm on my way to getting search."
